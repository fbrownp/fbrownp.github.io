												In this project I implemented a modified version of the model proposed 
												by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nag.3444" target="_blank"> Liao <i> et al</i> (2022) </a> 
												. Which used a different density function and two additional components as state variables, one that 
												captures the behavior of high dilantacy sands, and one that captures the effect of accumulated shear strain
												due to cyclic deformation &epsilon;<sub>acc</sub> , this factor is previously discussed in 
												<a href="https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/9780784481479.017" target="_blank"> Fuentes <i> et al</i> (2018) </a>.
												Results produced by the model are highly accurate (<strong>MAPE</strong> < 7%) for drained cases. Under undrained conditions, some considerations are proposed.

									<h2>A brief explanation about the model</h2>

											<h3>Differences between proposed and existent model for drained behavior</h3>
											<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3d3b3b">
												The base model used in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nag.3444" target="_blank"> Liao <i> et al</i> (2022) </a>
												is the one proposed by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nag.3444" target="_blank"> Wolffersdorff (1996) </a>
												which correspond to a hypoplastic model, which in words of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11440-017-0550-4" target="_blank"> Wu (2017) </a>
												have the deficiency of poisson ratio &nu; linked to &phi;<sub>crt</sub>, which was remedied by the author by adding a new term to the basic equation.
												This new equations reads as:
											</p>

											<span class="image object">
												<img src="images/hypo_model_1.png" alt="" width="80%" />
											</span>

											<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3d3b3b">
												Coefficients of the model, were determinated by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nag.3614" target="_blank"> Qian <i> et al</i> (2023) </a>
												in a close form that add a Yield surface equation capable of represent Drucker-Prager and 
												Matsuoka and Nakai criterions. Transforming <strong>equation 1</strong> into:
											</p>

											<span class="image object">
												<img src="images/hypo_model_2.png" alt="" width="80%" />
											</span>

											<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3d3b3b">
												Where <strong>I<sub>pe</sub></strong> represents the modification of initial stiffness due to 
												relative density and <strong>f<sub>d</sub></strong> allows to predict the behaviour of sands
												of different initial densities, the modified terms introduced in this work read as:

											</p>

											<span class="image object">
												<img src="images/hypo_model_3.png" alt="" width="80%" />
											</span>

											<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3d3b3b">
												One more important modification introduced into the model is a coefficient that soften the 
												stress peak due to high dilatancy, allowing to predict higher dilatancies without predicting 
												high stress peaks, this is done by introducing a new &Phi; which is a state variable
												of accumulated strain, which read as:

											</p>

											<span class="image object">

										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">

											<h3>Results from the presented equation</h3>

											<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3d3b3b">
												The results obtained from the first iteration, i.e. without 
												friction angle modification looks like:

												<img src="images/old_1.png" alt="" width="100%" />
											</span>
							
											<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3d3b3b">
												The friction angle modification produces a better description of 
												high dilatancy sands as presented in the next Figure:

											<h3>Differences between proposed and existent model for undrained behavior</h3>
											<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3d3b3b">
												The major difference between proposed model and the one by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nag.3444" target="_blank"> Liao <i> et al</i> (2022) </a>
												it's the aditional state variable considered to reproduce the cyclic mobility, where the proposed
												variable read as:

											</p>

											<span class="image object">
												<img src="images/hypo_model_5.png" alt="" width="80%" />
											</span>

											<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3d3b3b">
												Where <strong>&eta;<sub>2</sub></strong> it's a parameters that controls the rate of accumulation,
												<strong>&chi;<sub>2</sub></strong> controls the maximum value of <strong>&chi;</strong> parameters in 
												intergranular strain model, and <strong><i>Z</i></strong> is the norm of the fabric tensor.
											</p>

											<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3d3b3b">
												The key component of the formulation it's that every part of the model can be calibrated separatedly,
												and parameters related to semifluidized state doesn't change because of the additional state variable.
											</p>

											<h3>Comparison of the model with and without the new variable</h3>

											<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3d3b3b">
												Simulation results are presented for three examples, the first one 
												doesn't consider fabric anisotropy neither semifluidized state: 
											</p>

											<span class="image object">
												<img src="images/normal_model.png" alt="" width="100%" />
											</span>

											<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3d3b3b">
												Second one, considers fabric anisotropy and semifluidized state: 
											</p>

											<span class="image object">
												<img src="images/hypo_model_6.png" alt="" width="100%" />
											</span>
							
											<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3d3b3b">
												And the third one, considers the new variable to describe 
												cyclic mobility:

											</p>

											
											<span class="image object">
												<img src="images/hypo_model_7.png" alt="" width="100%" />
											</span>


											<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3d3b3b">
												As presented before, it can be observed that the new variable does not affect the 
												semifluidized state and allows the user to simulate cyclic mobility, the calibration 
												and formulation of this state variable should be dependent on initial density as has been 
												studied by me, proximately, a formula will be introduced to represent the value of &chi;<sub>2</sub>
												as a variable of <i><strong>e</strong></i>.

									<h2>A brief conclusion</h2>
									<p style="font-size: 20px; color: #3d3b3b">
										In this project I developed a new constitutive model by merging different 
										components to reproduce the behaviour of sands. Under drained conditions, the model
										captures with a better accuracy the dilatant behavior by introducing a new state variable.
										For undrained cases, a state variable is introduced as a modification of the one proposed by 
										<a href="https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/9780784481479.017" target="_blank"> Fuentes <i> et al</i> (2018) </a>
										to reproduce cyclic mobility effects.
