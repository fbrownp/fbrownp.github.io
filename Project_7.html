											<h2>¿What did I do?</h2>
											<p style="font-size: 20px; color: #3d3b3b">
											In this project, I developed a Yield surface model for foundations subjected to multiple combinations of loads.
											First, the variables of interest to produce a yield surface are selected, as a second step, the sampling space is defined. Then, a Yield surface expression is formulated 
											and finally a machine learning model for regression is fitted using TensorFlow to automatize the process of calibration of constants for 
											different problems.</p>
											<p style="font-size: 20px; color: #3d3b3b">
												A brief explanation is presented in the next chapters!!

									<h3>Variable selection</h3>

									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3d3b3b">
												The variables of interest to fit a simplified model are: <strong>c, &phi;, &delta;, H/Df</strong> and <strong>Df/B</strong>.
												Soil parameters <strong>c</strong> and <strong>&phi;</strong> are selected to represent the usual resistance parameters 
												used in every bearing capacity formula, <strong>&delta;</strong> is the percentage of interface resistance between soil and foundation. 
												The last two factors were chosen to represent geometric properties and different types of foundations. The sampling
												space is presented in <strong>Table 1</strong>.</p>

											<h3>Calculation definition</h3>

											<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3d3b3b">
												<strong>OptumG2</strong> is used to determine the ultimate loads associated with every sample in <strong>Table 1</strong>.
												All finite element limit analysis simulation
												consisted in a foundation subjected to different levels of vertical load capacity
												<strong> <i>V/V<sub>f</sub></i> </strong> subjected to combined loads as presented in the next video.

											<h3>Results from sampling</h3>
											<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3d3b3b">
											When every calculation was completed. Every load pattern was used to calibrate a mathematical model
											by hyperparameter optimization as presented in the next video.</p>

									<h3>Results from optimization</h3>
									<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3d3b3b">An example of the results obtained from optimization process
										is presented in the next Figure.</p>

										data obtained from simulations is presented in red dots.</p>

									<h2>Machine learning model</h2>
									<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3d3b3b">The development of the complete machine learning model is presented in the
										<a href="foundation_machine_learning/Foundation_data_ann.html" class="logo" target="_blank"> Jupyter Notebook.</a>
									</p>
									
									<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3d3b3b">The results obtained from mixing machine learning and mathematical model
										allows us to do a parametric study of the foundation's shapes which is presented below:

										<video width="100%" height="600" controls poster="images/foundation_machine_6.png">
											<source src="Presentación3-3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
										</video>
									</span>

									<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3d3b3b">From the video it can be observed that data points are really well described
										by the curves (<strong>Mathematical model + Machine learning</strong>) for different initial conditions.
									</p>
									<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #3d3b3b">It is also observable that the <strong>Yield surface</strong> model 
										change with different geometries, specially the interaction in <strong>m<sub>i</sub></strong> - <strong>h<sub>i</sub></strong>
										plane.

									<h2>A brief conclusion</h2>

									<p style="font-size: 20px; color: #3d3b3b"> The use of
										mathematical models with machine learning techniques allows to predict the capacity of foundations under
										combined loads with high accuracy using an advanced expression to describe the yield surface that captures
										the interaction between horizontal and moment loads for different geometries.
